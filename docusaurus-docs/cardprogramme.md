# Card Programmes

A card programme is a predefined card product that can be issued to customers. Each card programme has a number of key characteristics including:

Fees
: A fixed a mount charge that is made to the card balance on a regular occurence

Interest
: A variable amount that is either credited or debited to the card, based on the card balance

Rewards
: A reward given on a set interval that doesn't effect the card balance directly.

## Creating A Card Programme

Before you can issue cards, you need to decide what your card programme should offer to customers. The below example shows creating a card with:

* A 20% interest rate, charged monthly
* A $100 sign up fee
* 2 Aeroplan points with every purchase
